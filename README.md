## Dev Notes

This project was fantastic for learning React. It compelled me to grasp and apply the useState and props flow, offering flexibility in implementing reusable components.

For the most part, this project was straightforward. However, I encountered challenges when attempting to make the resume items editable. Since useState and props were new concepts for me at the project's outset, my files became convoluted and confusing. This prompted me to create an App Flow chart and UI wireframe in Figma. This visual aid helped me better visualize the structure and intricacies of the project, encouraging a more thoughtful approach rather than solely coding until encountering issues.

While the final version of 1.0 looks a bit different the the Appl flow chart, the chart laid a great foundation down for me to problem solve and finish this project.
